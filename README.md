# 2D_Engine

Honestly this will be more like a library for 2D graphics, but the goal for this is to learn c++ as well as learn graphics rendering at a low level. This will also be my introduction to game development

### Challenges
- Separating Engine from Game

### How To Run

Currently I only have a makefile for my personal environment. However I plan on making a cmake in the future.
