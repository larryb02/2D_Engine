Will update with images and features

### Challenges
- Vertex Data:
    - The challenge is handling the layout
        - I could assume that there is one format for all data i.e. (x, y, color, tex cords), but this isnt realistic

                - Create my own data structure and set default values?
                    - how do i handle stride, offset, etc...
    - Solution:
- Render Architecture:

### How To Run
