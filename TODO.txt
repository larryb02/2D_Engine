Planned:
- Refactor makefile so it generates object files
- Make _window a smart pointer
    - convert all pointers to smart pointers eventually
- Write test cases for:
    - Texture Class
- potentially make a header with common includes
- Considering separating windowing into its own class 
- Text Rendering
- Sprite Rendering
- Scene Manager
- Find/handle potential memory leaks
	- optimizing......!
- Adjust projection matrix scale
    - so i don't have to use these small screen bounds

Current Task:
- Write Scene > Scene Object > Render Data pipeline

In Progress:
- Scene class
	- we want references of Entities not pointers, don't plan on modifying entities from scene directly...

- Proper Input System
    - Create methods that provide interface to keyboardstate, gamepad state, and mouse state

- Camera class
    - methods to add:
        - rotation
    - 

- Add more functionality to Vertex Structure
    - RGB
